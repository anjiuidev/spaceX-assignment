# SpaceXLaunch

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server

Run `npm run dev:ssr` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build:ssr` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
After that Run `npm run serve:ssr` to tun the project. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`.

## Approach
Project mainly contains 1 module(App), 3 components(App, Main, Filters) and 1 service(App).

App component is the root component for the other components.
Filters component is responsible for all the filters.
Main component is responsible for loading the data.
